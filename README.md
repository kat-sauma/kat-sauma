That's right, a Front-End leaning Full Stack Software Engineer with a keen eye for d e s i g n! 

Not to mention, an aquarius, a believer of the impossible, and a creative packing a whole lot of elbow grease. 
I am a curious Kat, able to scope a project from beginning to end, and craft detailed, bold visual landscapes that attract enlivened audiences through clean code and intentional art. My work hones the user's experience to be a fluid experience while harnessing expression. 

+  recent projects include: 
        -  volunteering back-end services in Javascript to the Black Resilience Fund
        -  designing and developing an npm package Pixel Pusher! --> a pixel painting app for the Terminal to make visual poems
        -  design and front-end services for a startup app Support System to provide marginalized communities with a search for medical providers

+  looking to collaborate on projects with socially focused impact or artistic explorations in the visual, musical, or live performance realm.

+  help me with algorhithmic animations any time!

+  hunt me down for CSS questions or talk out a project idea

+  get to know me a layer deeper:
        - non-binary
        - queer
        - middle-eastern
        - post-modern dancer
